The Future
    </h2>
    <p>
        For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to do something with computers.
        The main issue was my own self doubt. I didn't believe I had the ability to do it.
        As I got older, I figured out that I actually had quite the talent for 
        understanding programming and it encouraged me to take the next step into development.
        What started as me making basic games on Roblox that barely functioned, is now transitioning
        into an actual possibility for my future career. <b><u>This is my goal.</u></b>
